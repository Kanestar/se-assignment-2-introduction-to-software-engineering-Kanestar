# SE-Assignment-2
Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles ,methodsand tools to design,develop,test and maintain software systems.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?software engineering is the systemic application of engineering principles ,methodsand tools to design,develop,test and maintain software systems while tradititional coding centres solely on technical coding.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
requirements -specify detailed requirements for the software and understand user needs and constraints.
design -focuses on creating a detailed blueprint for the software to outlone the systems architechture.
implementation -writing code and building the software according to the design specification.
design -focuses on creating a detailed blueprint for the software to outlone the systems architechture.
testing - conduct thorough testing to identify and fix issues to ensure the software meets quality standards.
deployment -releasing the software to the users to ensure it works as expected.
maintenance -providing ongoing updates, support and enhancement to the software post deployment.

Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models: 
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?wodel involves sequential approach with distinct phases that requires deliverables for each phase before moving to the next. waterfall is used for projects which have clear and fixed requirements and need to meet strict regulations. agile is an iterative and incremental approach focusedon flexibility,collaboration and responding to change. agile is suitable for projects that are uncertain innnovative or fast paced.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.requirements engineering is a systematic process used in engineering projects to define ,document and maintain requirements for sostware systems.It translates imprecise user needs into precise and formal specifications, setting a strong foundation for the entire software development.
Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
 Modularity in software design refers to a logical partitioning of the software into smaller, independent modules. These modules are cohesive, loosely coupled components that perform specific functions or handle particular features.
Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
unit testing -verifies individual modules or components
integration testing -ensures that different modules work together seamlessly
system testing -validates the entire software system as a whole
acceptance testing -testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs
Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.Version control systems  are software tools that help track changes made to code over time. they maintain consistent codebase ensuring everyone has the same foundation. examples are git,subversion and mercurial
Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects? project managers are the navigators who guide the team toward project completion while balancing constraints and expectations. the responsiblities include; monitoring progress,risk management,collaboration,planning and defining. the challenges involved are poor communication,changing technology and changing requirements.
Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?Software maintenance is the process of changing, modifying, and updating software to keep up with customer needs. types of maintenance activities:
adaptive maintenance -Modifies the software to work in new or changed environments.
corrective maintenance -Fixes bugs and defects in the software.
preventive maintenance - Identifies and addresses potential issues before they become significant problems.
perfective maintenance -Enhances performance and adds new features.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work? the challenges are; algorithmic bias,corporate ownership of personal data,addictive design and overemphasis on features. 
Submission Guidelines:
Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
Provide real-world examples or case studies wherever possible.
Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
